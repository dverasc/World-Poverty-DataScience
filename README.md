# World-Poverty-LinearReg

File Name: WorldPovertyRegression.py

This project used the World Poverty datasets and I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks as my tools.
In this project, I explored the data set and used visualization packages to get a more intuitive sense of the data.
Following the exploration, I decided to evaluate the relationship between GDP per capita and other factors such as life expectancy, population, and year.
Finally, I visualized and printed the results of the linear regression that was trained using the cleaned data set

File Name: StatePoverty_SparkViz.py

For this project, I used a State Povery dataset and tools (Python, Jupyter Notebooks) and added Spark as a way to add speed to calculations
In this project, I created a dataframe using just the Southern states and tracked the poverty rates from 2010-17. After creating this dataframe I visualized it using the matplotlib library.
