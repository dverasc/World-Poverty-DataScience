# World-Poverty-LinearReg

This project used the World Poverty Statistics world wide across decades.
In this project, I explored the data set and used visualization packages to get a more intuitive sense of the data.
Following the exploration, I decided to evaluate the realtionship between GDP per capita and other factors such as life expectancy, population, and year.
Finally, I visualized and printed the results of the linear regression that was trained using the cleaned data set
